This file contains classes for different noise models including classification, regression and semi-supervised learning. 

10/10/2006 Fixed sign error in likelihood for ordered model. This error was propagated because of a sign error in ndlutil.cpp. In this case two wrongs made a right.

1/3/2005 While looking for the bug that caused Gregg Keller problems, I found that when noise models where read from disk they were allocating storeage at the rong point. Moved initStoreage() out of setNumProcesses and set the numData to a dummy value in readParamsFromStream() to fix it.

This file now also contains the code for ordered categorical noise models.

21/10/2005 More changes from Bill, mostly removing redundant const modifiers.

20/10/2005 Incorporated William V. Baxter's code modifications for running the code with MSVC. Mostly this involved removing redundant const statements.
